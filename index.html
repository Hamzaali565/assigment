    <h1>The Story In The Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between 
        the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the scientific journals her work had 
        appeared in, was awell thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite Book
        since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free. 
    </p>
    <p>She had apent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
        proclaiming that <q>Work is refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many 
        considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic 
        acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better
        to do.
